Dan ManCa's THE GOAL

##The 3 Step Action Plan##

1)   Set Your Goal: Have you taken the time to clearly identify where you want your career to go - and how to get there? Sit down and clarify your goal until you can answer the question, "What are you looking for?" in 20 words or less.
 
2)   Develop Your Plan: Now that you know what role you want, develop a schedule of how you will spend your time over the next quarter. Create a detailed list of things you need to get done - and make sure you assign deadlines.
 
3)   Keep Yourself Organized: How many job applications do you have out there that are still possibilities? If you can't answer this question then your job search is NOT organized. You need a clear, efficient system that not only keeps track of the opportunities you're pursuing but also the specific people you need to follow up with.
