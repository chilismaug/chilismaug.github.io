			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
			 I am an Ohioan. Started out as a Hoosier and spent 12 years in the Garden State. Love NY and NJ but you gotta be rich.
			 These are all areas in the US of A, which hopes to one day join the civilized nations of the 3rd rock. Was a musician some and got to play at <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/nyregion/kennys-castaways-greenwich-village-music-club-is-closing.html> Kenney's Castaways
				and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s>Maxwell's</a>.   
			While in NJ I started being a computer geek and thankfully got some Unix exposure at AT&T, where <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie>Dennis</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson>Ken</a> and <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan>Brian</a> kicked things off.</p>
			<p>I feel that I must point out that Ken once <a href =http://genius.cat-v.org/ken-thompson/mig/>flew a MiG</a> for fun, and he also invented regular expressions. 
			
			<p>Proud analog native.</p>
