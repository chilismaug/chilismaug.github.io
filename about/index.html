			<p>Your bio here. No, my bio here!</p>
			<p>
			 I am an Ohioan. Started out as a Hoosier and spent 12 years in the Garden State. These are all areas in the US of A, which 
				hopes to one day rejoin civilization if it still exists.
			Love NY and NJ but you gotta be rich.
			 Was a musician some.  
			 Started being a computer geek in NJ and thankfully got some Unix exposure at AT&T.</p>
			<p>Proud analog native.</p>
