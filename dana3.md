* "Tell me about yourself."  
 

 I have a Bachelor of Science degree from UCLA in economics from 1995.   
 
 I have seven years of operations experience in Fortune 500s such as Boeing and five years of finance experience, with a successful track record of execution excellence.  
 
 I am here today because you are looking for someone with solid performance in ________ and _______ (from their job description).

* "Why should I hire you over other candidates?"  3 points from THEIR job description  

 You are looking for someone who can do ___________. I have excelled in that for three years.  

 You need someone who is ______________ and __________ and I can give specific examples where I have proven this is a core competency of mine.  

 You are looking for someone who is passionate about your company, your industry and this particular job. I really want this job, and I know I can deliver superior results for you and work well as a team member.  

* "Give me an example where you have failed."  
 Give a "middle" example that shows self-awareness AND what you learned:  

 I lead a major cross-team initiative but learned later that two people weren't fully on board. I should have met with each person individually, and I have done just that ever since.  

 I had to analyze and synthesize tons of data into a report for senior executives. I spent so much time proofing my data and cross checking that I finished it at the last minute. Since then, I have enlisted an extra pair of eyes to review my work, and I complete things earlier. 

 In sales, I called on a major prospective client for six months, continuing to work with the people responsible for making the buying decision. However, I should have also worked the executive suite, including the CFO, with a value proposition that appealed to them. I learned how to do both effectively.
