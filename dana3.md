"Tell me about yourself."

I have Bachelor's in MIS from The Union Institute, which followed from an Associate degree from Thomas Edison State College in CS/T. 
I have over 20 years of software integration and development experience working in large corporations as well as small and nonprofit companies.
I am here today because you are looking for someone with solid performance working with healthcare integration and data interfaces.

"Why should I hire you over other candidates?" 

take 3 points from THEIR job description
You are looking for someone who can handle a wide range of software life cycle roles and I have performed many jobs such as testing, requirements analysis, training and troubleshooting infrastructure issues involving software and hardware integration.
You need someone who is familiar with translating designs/user stories to code as well as who can help explain technical issues to users, management and other technical staff - this is a core interest and competency of mine.
You are looking for someone who is passionate about your company, your industry and this kind of job.
I really want this job, and I know I can deliver superior results for you and work well as a team member.

"Give me an example where you have failed."

Creating IA reports I spent so much time heads down that I sometimes get too far down the rabbit hole or just don't ask for help when others appear buried - always trying to beware not to do that and of looking out for others who might need another pair of eyes.
