"Tell me about yourself."  

I have an Associate degree from Thomas Edison State College in CS/T from 1997 and  
a Bachelor's from The Union Institute in MIS from 2001.  

I have over 20 years of software integration and development experience in large corporations as well as small and nonprofit companies.  

I am here today because you are looking for someone with solid performance working with healthcare integration and data interfaces.  


"Why should I hire you over other candidates?" 3 points from THEIR job description   

You are looking for someone who can handle a wide range of software life cycle roles and I have performed many jobs such as testing,   requirements analysis, training and troubleshooting infrastructure issues involving software and hardware integration.   
  
You need someone who is familiar with translating designs/user stories to code as well as who can help explain technical issues to users, management and other technical staff - this is a core interest and competency of mine.   

You are looking for someone who is passionate about your company, your industry and this kind of job.  
I really want this job, and I know I can deliver superior results for you and work well as a team member.  
  
* "Give me an example where you have failed."  - a "middle" example that shows self-awareness AND what you learned:  

 I lead a major cross-team initiative but learned later that two people weren't fully on board. I should have met with each person individually, and I have done just that ever since.  

 I had to analyze and synthesize tons of data into a report for senior executives. I spent so much time proofing my data and cross checking that I finished it at the last minute. Since then, I have enlisted an extra pair of eyes to review my work, and I complete things earlier. 

 In sales, I called on a major prospective client for six months, continuing to work with the people responsible for making the buying decision. However, I should have also worked the executive suite, including the CFO, with a value proposition that appealed to them. I learned how to do both effectively.
