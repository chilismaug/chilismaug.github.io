Using the GitHub Pages as demonstrated in [Jonathan McGlone's tute-example](https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io) - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Like Hank, I can use Markdown to author my posts.  

This Pages site looks a little more clunky on a desktop browser than McGlone's [Hank Quinlan](https://hankquinlan.github.io) site because I have been trying to make it more responsive even progressive. I have had to make some compromises, pending further skills. Try resizing the window and see how it scales. Unlike [Hank's](https://hankquinlan.github.io) site, I can read this one on my ittby bitty iPhone SE!
