Using the GitHub Pages as demonstrated in [Jonathan McGlone's tute-example](https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io) - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts.  

This Pages site looks a little more clunky on a desktop browser than McGlone's [Hank Quinlan](https://hankquinlan.github.io) site because I have been trying to make it more responsive, maybe even progressive someday. I have had to make some compromises or maybe just kludges awaiting further skills. Try resizing the window and see how it scales. Now I can read it on my ittby bitty iPhone SE!
