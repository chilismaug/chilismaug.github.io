            Since I've always been in "Enterprise IT" doing B2B stuff, there's no street-facing art to show from work.
            But here's some things that I've munged together based on tutorial/sample code and dropped on the free clouds. <br>
            <h1>Big screens</h1>
            <ul>
		<li>
			<a href="https://gae-gcs-servlet.appspot.com/hello">PhraseOmatic.</a> A Java servlet example that started out from 
			HeadFirst Java, with some enhancements, like a style sheet, and data loaded from text files rather than inline. 
			This is deployed to Google Cloud Platform's App Engine. I just figured out how to get the files 
			to be streamed from Google Cloud Storage buckets, so I can tweak my nonsense without recompiling. Content Management at last.

                    on <span data-tag>Google Cloud</span>, using Python's Flask framework. This is a current weather picker based on Tristan Ganry's <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-a-web-app-using-pythons-flask-and-google-app-engine-52b1bb82b221">
                        Medium article, grabbing weather info from an API
                    </a> - I added a JSON data file for the city picklist, housed in a Goo Cloud Storage bucket, so I can change City data without touching code. 
			On the UI side, I merged request/response views to act more "single-pagey".

			way. This is based on Brandon Morelli's blogtorial in his codeburst offering, with a few tweaks to get it on Heroku. I got a Google Places API autocomplete

                    RYDE! Service defaults to Seattle but I called one to Boise, no Prob. I added a
                    footer link (scroll waayyy... down) to call your Unicorn for a Ride.

			To build this you follow the steps to wire up AWS services including DynamoDB, REST API and Lambda. 
			All the psychedelic page art and Lambda code was provided, FYI. I lapsed my AWS subs but the app still lives.
